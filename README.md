# RC Broadcaster

This is the shell script to broadcast questions to a publicly available domain, so that the services can update their local storage / indexes of questions and the state of the application remains consistent.

## Usage
Run the broadcast.sh file. You might need to change the domain name etc. as the specifics given in this file will be occupied by the time the project becomes public.
```
chmod +x broadcast.sh

./broadcast.sh
```
